# EclipseBrowser

**Privacy-first experimental browser for iOS.**  
Built for users who want browsing sessions that leave no trace.

## Key principles
- **No persistence** — no history, no cookies, no cache. Nothing is written to disk.
- **Session-only browsing** — everything is wiped when you close the app.
- **Basic tracker blocking** — blocks common ad and tracking domains.
- **DuckDuckGo by default** — private search out of the box.
- **Dark-first design** — minimal UI, black theme, crescent moon branding.

## What EclipseBrowser is (and isn’t)
- ✅ A lightweight, opinionated browser for privacy-focused users
- ❌ Not a Chrome replacement
- ❌ Not built for accounts, logins, or long sessions

## Distribution
EclipseBrowser is **closed-source** and distributed via **AltStore**.
